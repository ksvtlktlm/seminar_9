588;Medroxyprogesterone;Birth Control;"""I&#039;m 19 years old and I have only been on the shot for 3 months and some change now. I like the shot. I had regular periods before but they were really heavy and painful. I tried the pills once and took all of them. A couple of times I forgot to take them on time but took two the next day but the shot works better for me. The only negative thing I have to say is it does mess with my moods, like I&#039;ll get sad out of no where and start tripping and the weight gain I don&#039;t mind because I&#039;m already a size 3, I want to gain some weight. During the first month I spotted the whole time. Not a regular period just brown spotting. But it&#039;s gone away now and like I said I&#039;ve only been on it for 3 months and some change now so overall for me, I like.""";7;5-Aug-12;2
182733;Cymbalta;ibromyalgia;"""For almost 2 years I had felt like I was exhausted and in pain all of the time. Was told that it was osteoarthritis and because of my getting adult acquired flat feet. Finally went to an arthritis doctor who said it was fibromyalgia and started on Cymbalta two weeks ago. Within 5 days, I felt relief. It have given me hope to be able to do things without constant pain. I still get tired easily, but I can finally sleep at night and not nearly as stiff in the morning. I was scared to death when reading about the side effects. Other than a headache for a few days... that was all for me. Sooo glad it has changed my life.""";9;5-May-17;41
52437;Pantoprazole;Gastritis/Duodenitis;"""I was prescribed this following three or four days with crippling stomach pain caused by gastritis&#039; within a few hours I had immediate relief and within 36 hours felt virtually back to normal, so much so that I ceased taking the medication on day 4 or 5 (supported by my GP).

146917;Alprazolam;Depression;"""I know what it&#039;s like to lose 30 pounds in one month from depression. No appetite, can&#039;t walk without getting tired, laying in bed all day crying &amp; nightmares night after night. It&#039;s so annoying when psychs&#039; won&#039;t prescribe this because of fear of addiction. Well guess what? If I hadn&#039;t have found xanax, I would have committed suicide a long time ago. You can take this medicine long term if you have severe depression and are responsible.""";10;11-Oct-16;82
28358;Lexapro;Depression;"""Sexually frustrated me and I was a little bit aggressive coming onto it. EVERYONE has a specific anti-depressant that will work for them. It&#039;s all trial and error. However, even though it didn&#039;t work for me, I&#039;m a fan of the medication. Prozac, however, did the job.""";6;9-Feb-14;36
16407;Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone;Birth Control;"""I came on here to write a good review because I feel like people are so quick to put their opinions out if a medication is bad way before if it is good for them! With that being said, if you are on here because you just started taking this medicine or just prescribed it and haven&#039;t started it, its sooo important to remember YOUR body isn&#039;t like another woman&#039;s, birth control effects everyone different so don&#039;t let some of these scary/bad reviews scare you( you&#039;ll find them under every type of BC review). What may be great for you, might be horrible for someone else. This is great for me!""";10;29-Jan-16;23

34307;Bystolic;High Blood Pressure;"""This drug was a nightmare for me.  I unfortunately had B12 deficiency at the same time so it took a longish time to figure this drug was murdering me in addition to my troubles with B12.  It did keep my BP very low but.... it made my legs feel almost lame and if I tried to walk even remotely fast I&#039;d feel like I was going to pass out.  It also cranked by A1C way up.  The worst 6 months of my life pretty much.  A week after coming off it I felt reborn.""";1;16-Aug-17;8
124380;Skyla;Birth Control;"""I had the Skyla implant done on October 19th 2015. It was by far more painful than I was imagining it was going to be. I had started my period the day before and I was only spotting. I wasn&#039;t told to take any pain medicine before I went, but after reading the review on this site I wish I had. I was given pain medication to numb the area but it didn&#039;t seem to help at all. It took my OB about 5-7 minutes to insert the device and while he had the applicator in me it was the worst pain I&#039;ve ever experienced. I kept covering my mouth because I was practically screaming because of the pain. It felt like the doctor had a stick and was just moving around in my cervix and my stomach. Terrible cramping for the first 2 days but no more pills for me!""";5;30-Oct-15;1

76073;Ezetimibe / simvastatin;High Cholesterol;"""My last labs were awesome.  My doctor was quite pleased.  Both my LDL and triglycerides were way down and in the low normal range.  No small feat since I have had Type 1 diabetes for 31 years.""";10;6-Dec-08;20
120006;Losartan;High Blood Pressure;"""I was forced to take Losartan instead of Diovan because my insurance company refuses to pay for brand name drugs.  Really great the insurance co. would rather realize huge profits at the expense of patients&#039; health.  Well, Losartan is terrible for me.  I had no noticeable side effects from Diovan.  But with the Losartan I&#039;ve had not only hair loss but also very bad tingling down my left arm into my fingers.  My doctor just told me it&#039;s carpal tunnel syndrome without any hesitation, but I know it&#039;s the Losartan that&#039;s causing this condition because I never had it until after starting Losartan.  It also causes me to be tired and lightheaded, both side effects of this medicine.""";2;17-Sep-11;145
109622;Nexplanon;Birth Control;"""I&#039;ve been on my period for over 5 months.. it sucks. Sometimes I&#039;m light or spotting and then randomly I&#039;ll get heavy.

70668;Flomax;Urinary Tract Stones;"""I get Kidney Stones on a near daily basis trying to pass. I&#039;ve been in the hospital a total of 35 times in the last year. Each for Kidney Stone pain. After my third visit the doc gave me Flomax and it passed 5 stones all 3-5mm in size within 30 minutes of me taking it. Since then no other Doctor would give it to me because &quot;I didn&#039;t need it&quot;. Well finally yesterday my doc agreed with me and wrote the prescription I passes a 8mm stone 30 mins after taking the Flomax. I HIGHLY recommended this to anyone who is suffering from a kidney stone. It reduces the pain and makes the passing a WHOLE lot easier.""";10;10-Jul-14;113
62994;Tranexamic acid;Menstrual Disorders;"""Where has this been all my life?  My cycles were really heavy.  I would use an ultra tampon and have an overnight pad on as well.  I would go to the bathroom every hour.  Now I can go every 3-4 hours.  I don&#039;t have to worry about getting up in the middle of the night changing pads.  Now I can move on with life and don&#039;t have to worry about going somewhere on cycle days.""";10;22-Dec-16;23

101643;Methocarbamol;Muscle Spasm;"""I twisted my back and threw it out. Was given 500mg three times a day, and it does absolutely nothing at all. My back feels worse than before. It did not relieve any stiffness or pain. Also found out that this medication is unstudied, and the mechanism of action is also unknown. This is a pharmaceutical test product. Its effects are placebo at best.""";1;8-May-17;16
17574;Ethinyl estradiol / etonogestrel;Birth Control;"""I was using the Nuva ring after a tubal ligation to control my periods. They had been really heavy and it was great at doing that. 2 yrs in I had a pulmonary embolism and nearly died. Something I now realise was probably from the Nuva ring. Massive class action in the US over this. I didn&#039;t realise at the time. I went of it 3 months ago and have not regretted it at all. Libido returned to normal after so long. My husband was beginning to get annoyed. Not only that just feels better during sex without it.""";4;29-Sep-16;5
186186;Desvenlafaxine;Depression;"""So I had anxiety and depression. My GP prescribed Lexapro initially, then Wellbutrin, then Zoloft (coupled with Xanax). Nothing was working and I was waking up in the morning every day with panic attacks. My GP recommended I go to a Psych, which I did for first time in my life. He changed me to long acting Xanex XR   Pristiq. Both have been massively better and Pristiq could be a game changer. The side effects I had adjusting to SSRIs were very very bad but getting on Pristiq has been very easy. Only a headache for 2 days. I recommend people try this. My panic attacks and anxiety literally vanished after 3-4 days. I feel like I finally found what I needed.""";9;20-Dec-13;89
179849;Adapalene / benzoyl peroxide;Acne;"""I had moderate acne and got put on epiduo and lymecycline anti-biotics. It has been 13 weeks and my acne is a lot better than it was at the start, but I still get pimples and have a lot of scarring and hyper pigmentation which will take time to fade. For the first 5 weeks my skin got a lot worse and I had more acne than when I first started the treatment. Gradually between 9 and 12 weeks my breakouts were becoming less often and overall I would recommend Epiduo if you can stick out the initial 5-6 weeks which are difficult.""";8;12-Jul-15;9
199617;Zonegran;Migraine Prevention;"""I took 300mg of zonegran for nearly 2 years. It worked really well to prevent my migraines at the start--it was like a dream come true. I did experience appetite reduction and weight loss, but I put it back on after about a year. The negative side effects were extreme for me over time. First, my depression got much worse. That could have been external factors, but the time that I started taking Zonegran and the severe increase in my symptoms match. Also, after some time, I noticed my cognitive function was severely inhibited. I was in graduate school at the time and began failing classes, slurring my words when 100% sober, and unable to remember things. When I went off, my migraines returned severely, especially period and allergy migraines""";7;18-Mar-16;36
53306;QNASL;Allergic Rhinitis;"""My son tried every prescription spray out there for his allergies. QNasl finally worked for him! He loves that it&#039;s not a drippy wet spray- it&#039;s more like a fine powder. It stays where it needs to be. He loves it. I can tell when he forgets to use it because he has a runny nose and watery eyes again. Only occasionally when pollen counts are extremely high does it still gives him breakthrough runny nose. Most of the time it&#039;s as if he doesn&#039;t have terrible allergies at all. Worked miracles for us!""";8;10-Apr-15;7
12459;Ortho Micronor;Birth Control;"""I&#039;ve been taking this pill for over a year now and I must say out of 3 different birth control pills I have taken this one seems to be the best! Skin didn&#039;t break out and did not gain or lose any weight. For months at a time I didn&#039;t get no period and that was awesome because my cramps on period are terrible so that was a plus. Honestly I is probably different for each individual but for my self a 19 year old girl at the time weighing 110pounds felt great I do recommend""";10;26-Sep-16;12
92912;Vortioxetine;Depression;"""December 2016 I started on 5mg of Trintellix. I&#039;d reached a point in life, 65, where my life was more than I could ask for: good job, strong marriage, good friends, healthy, and yet I lived a dark cloud of fatigue and disconnection, lacking excitement and motivation. I was just maintaining. So I tried Trintellix. I&#039;m now on 10mg. For me I&#039;ve had little to no symptoms, and a rebirth of joy, motivation, and creativity. I&#039;ve also added a weekly exercise routine at the local Planet Fitness. Between diet and exercise I find this modern medicine to be a miracle. Of course I realize my body will probably adjust to this feeling and I wont&#039; be quite &#039;euphoric&#039; forever, but I now know what feeling good feels like.""";10;10-Feb-17;128
171013;Quetiapine;Borderline Personality Disorde;"""My life has almost completely turned around.... in the best ways possible. Other medicines never did anything good or just nothing at all and they just kept upping the doses on me.  Then they started me on this crazy expensive medicine and I tell you it&#039;s just amazing! It is totally worth it.... my social life is back.... I have my friends back.... and close family members. Well it feels like I&#039;m loved again and there&#039;s nothing really to think and think and think over and over and over again anymore, and sleeping is good again. I can sleep and not worry or think. Just totally worth it. """;9;3-Apr-10;66

190404;Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo;Birth Control;"""I am 20, and have been using this birth control a little over a year. It is my first birth control pill. Effective at preventing pregnancy but that&#039;s the only plus. Overall I think it&#039;s an okay pill, but I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s the best. It takes about three months to adjust to it, and taking it at night helps with the nausea and headaches you may experience. I have gained 15 pounds while on the pill, which is very disappointing because my diet is better now than it was before and I&#039;ve always been very active and attend the gym. The weight is hard for me to shed now..it&#039;s frustrating. My periods are normal for the most part, but sometimes they come a little later and carry over when I&#039;m back on active pills.

24875;Avodart;Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia;"""Been on it for a week and so far I really have seen improvement.  Have middle lobe enlarged prostate.  Have had symptoms for probably 20 years but mid-lob diagnosis was not found out until a sonogram of the prostate.  No side effects so far.  Sex drive seems to be okay.  Was worried about that one.  Now instead of going to urinate 1-2 times an hour I now go about once every 4 hours!  Huge improvement.""";10;6-Sep-10;93
210197;Linzess;Constipation, Chronic;"""I guess my experience is unique in that I am an eating disorder survivor and my chronic constipation originated from purging (forcing myself to vomit &amp;/or take huge quantities of various kinds of laxatives) for many years... I have been taking Linzess for about 16 months now. I would say it took 3-4 months for it to actually start working for me, but when it did, it seriously changed my life for the better. However, lately it has not really been working at all, which is extremely anxiety-provoking and concerning, as it took me forever to find a solution to my problem...and now I might have to start looking for another.""";7;8-Apr-16;30
21255;Focalin XR;ADHD;"""My son takes Focalin XR for his adhd. I like the medicine but my only complaint is a side effect that is not listed anywhere when I research Focalin. The side effect my son experiences is digging in the ear or the sensation of something in his ear that he needs to get out. The higher the dosage the worse the digging is. I have talked to the doctors, had his ears checked and put on allergey medicines, he still digs in his ears. He does really well with the medicine in school and activities out side of school. I have not seen any other side effect for this medication.""";9;8-Dec-16;11
151986;Chantix;Smoking Cessation;"""I tried Chantix for a period of 2 months.  My cravings for a cigarette eased until I cut down to about 3 per day.  The nausea lasted for about 20 minutes after each dose and got better over time.  The vivid dreams, constipation, and gas got worse. I understand this medication is not going to work the same for everyone. I believe there is a short window of opportunity when you either quit or you don&#039;t. When I was down to 3 per day, I probably should have quit.  This medicine began to make me agitated, anxious and very hard to get along with, to say the least. I still smoke unfortunately.

93901;Trintellix;Depression;"""I have an awful film in my mouth.
I sleep too much.
I have no energy.
I am very worried because it seems like I have spasms in my esophagus. 
I do like this prescription because I do not cry all the time.
Too expensive.""";8;21-Jun-17;13
88345;Adderall;ADHD;"""For me, Adderall is a dream and a nightmare all wrapped in one pill. When I wake up I need the adderall just to be productive in my day, it works like a charm and makes me more creative and motivated. But I find that I need more and more to keep going. Eventually when the day is over and its too late to take any more pills, I feel zoned out and unable to sleep. If adderral came with a powerful sleep medicine,  it would be a perfect drug. Although I don&#039;t like the anti-social aspect that comes with it. You get so concentrated that you become socially awkward and don&#039;t want to talk with anybody. Also when I drink on adderall I can become crazy aggressive at times. But other than that I love adderall, I&#039;ve done some of my best work on it.""";9;17-Feb-15;47

I take it sparingly and only when absolutely necessary. It has minimal side effects and since I take it only at bedtime, I do not have drowsiness in the morning. I sleep well and have lessened pain for about 2 - 3 hrs in the morning. I am lost without this help. My md gave me ultram which does not help and causes dizziness in the morning. Everyone is different.""";8;2-Jul-11;13

However, I have experience many side effects with forteo: 5 min after injection (which I hate), I start feeling tremendous pain at the lowe part of my spine. I found out that I can aleviate this pain by moving around (walking fast) for 15 min. I also discovered a very bad interaction with alcohol. Even a small glass of sangria during dinner, had as a result the development of an extreme pain after injection and inability to move for 45 min. Recently, I have also experienced a similar problem when I was on azythromycin for some mouth infection....Other symptoms I have 2 h after injection are flu-kind symptoms, shivering, insomnia""";4;4-Nov-15;87
47569;Tapentadol;Pain;"""When I first went to PM he took me off my 6 x 10mg hydrocodone/day.  I have had triple fusion in my neck, multiple knee surgeries, arthritis, migraines chronic kidney stones so I stay in chronic pain. I was terrified to go off hydros, that has been my only source of pain relief. Well. The 100mg ER. Didn&#039;t work so I had withdrawal from hydrocodone and then the pain was horrible.  I went back to the PM And he upped my dose to 150mg ER. Twice a day, and 75mg. Once a day for breakthrough pain. It was like magic. It was wonderful.  As long as I don&#039;t over exert myself I rarely need the breakthrough medicine. It is great pain medicine once you get the right dose.""";10;29-Mar-13;5
144705;Etonogestrel;Birth Control;"""My doctor recommended for me to get the nexplanon and I absolutely love it. She recommended I get it while I was on my period and I went ahead and got it on day one and I was done bleeding by day 3 and I haven&#039;t had any issues with it since then. It&#039;s been 3 months. No spotting, no side effects. I have actually lost quite a bit a weight with this in my arm. I recommend this form of birth control""";10;11-Feb-16;5

16386;Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone;Birth Control;"""I felt the need to write something because it seems like this gets several bad reviews.

I will say the first few weeks were pretty bad.  Spotting and cramps but that&#039;s it - once I got used to the hormones, it&#039;s been smooth sailing ever since.  Expect to spot on this (like every other BC I&#039;d bet) but doubling-up for a few days stops that.  No mood swings and cleared up minor acne so I recommend trying it for yourself!  Everyone has different reactions, I did.""";8;13-Feb-16;9
225483;Bupropion;Depression;"""I started taking Wellbutrin 150mg one week ago. I suffer from mild depression, but I feel like I am going through a rough patch in my marriage/life and needed something to change.  I exercise regularly, own a business and sleep well, but just didn&#039;t have that &quot;get up and go&quot; that I felt others had.  So, my doctor had given me a prescription for Lexapro that had horrible side effects right off the bat.  Heartburn, insomnia, and this kind of stressed out feeling that made me VERY uncomfortable. My doc gave me a new prescription for Wellbutrin and I take it the moment I wake up each morning.  I feel Happy, Energetic and Ready to tackle the day.  No insomnia, but I do have a reduced appetite.  This may be just the ticket!""";8;16-Jun-14;207

I feel my self esteem has increased, as well as toleration of speaking to people and being in crowds. Only thing is that my appetite has gone up somewhat, and I&#039;ve gained a little weight. But that is only a small price to pay for a happier life.""";9;9-Dec-16;22

The combo works great.  I have horrible insomnia/waking in the night on just Lexapro (or other SSRI&#039;s I&#039;ve tried) but with Saphris I sleep great and wake up refreshed!  Only downside is that I&#039;ve put on 10-15 pounds in the last 6 months, but not sure if it is due to the Lexapro or Saphris or both.  I eat very healthy (just too much) and exercise regularly....but find myself always feeling hungry.  Oh well...at least I&#039;m happy!""";9;17-Aug-13;41
169429;Diethylpropion;Obesity;"""The first month I was on diethylpropion I had a little headache but it goes away. I lost 11 lbs in the first month. The second month I was on this I lost only 3 lbs, its because you still do have to exercise. So I was off of it for 1 month and gained about 4lbs because I went back to my old habits of overeating and I didn&#039;t watch what I was eating. I think this pill will still work even if you get off of it, you just have to watch what you eat and count calories.
I&#039;m back on it again and I have had some headaches but it went away. """;10;3-Sep-09;14
42609;Concerta;ADHD;"""I am a college student and found that for the first two months, Concerta worked wonders. It improved my mood, attention, and energy. It even helped with headaches. However, as I write this at 3 am, the side effect of sleep disruption has become unbearable. I either don&#039;t sleep for days or sleep for 20 hours a day for a week. Don&#039;t write it off, though. It is definitely effective and adjusting the dose may do the trick.""";8;9-Dec-11;12
138478;Phentermine;Weight Loss;"""I took phentermine about 2 years ago and I lost 53lbs in two months, but then after it was like it didn&#039;t work anymore. On March 11, 2014 I talked to my Dr about wanting to lose weight and she prescribed phentermine capsules. The capsules are great because I found they last all day and I&#039;m never hungry. I work at night so I take one just before going to work and I don&#039;t get sleepy at work anymore. As a matter of fact I am full of energy even into the morning. As of 04/24/2014 I went from 321lbs to 280lbs. If it worked this well without exercising and without eating right, I can only imagine the results if I changed my exercise and eating habits. We will see!""";10;25-Apr-14;48
